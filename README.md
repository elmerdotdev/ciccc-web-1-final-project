# Web 1 - Final Project (Team)

Goal: Create a responsive Beauty website using the provided Figma mockup.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. The team leader should create the GitHub project and invite their other members. Make sure to link the repository to the project
3. Using the provided Figma mockup, recreate this design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: [https://www.figma.com/design/hdmA1VIakgC2Yxt0xDDIyY/BC-Beauty---WMAD%2BUI%2FUXDesign?node-id=4106-556&t=NlOw72RJgvIYu6Cb-1]
4. Make sure to create and assign tasks to each member on the GitHub Project

## Reminders

- Create your branches. Do not work on the `main` branch!

## Page Notes

### Home

- **MAKE UP 101**: `All Classes` button doesn't need to work
- **DIY Beauty Corner**: Clicking on the thumbnails should open a video in a modal popup. You can use any video from YouTube. On smaller screens, the thumbnails become a slider
- **LET'S TALK**: This section will be similar to the functionality of the `Contact` page

### Portfolio

- **MY WORK**: You can switch between `Makeup` and `Hairstyle` by clicking on their tab names. You can use any effect you like (fade, slide, etc.). Clicking on the `View More` button doesn't do anything

### Contact

- **Services** tab: User can choose between 3 Event Types. The fields on the form will change depending on which Event Type is selected. Clicking on the `Next` button will show the next set of fields. Clicking on the `Submit` button will send the form to an email address (You can use EmailJS, SendGrid, etc.). Once the form is sent, show the last section which is the `Thank you` section
- **Thank you**: The Thank You section shows the name and the details entered on the form. For the estimated price, just use any amount
- **Classes**: There is no classes section so clicking on the tab name will not do anything

## Presentation

Presentation will be on next monday. Make sure you create a pull request to `main` once everything is done

Good luck! :)
